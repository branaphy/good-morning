## Introduction

Fatigue and its impact on cognitive functions have been subjects of extensive research over the years. The state of tiredness, often influenced by the circadian rhythm, can significantly affect an individual’s motor and 
cognitive abilities, thereby potentially altering the acoustic properties of speech. 

The motivation behind this study stems from the curiosity to explore how "morning grogginess" may impact speech production, which could have substantial implications in fields like voice recognition technology, speech 
pathology, and human-computer interaction. The goal of this study is to analyze and compare the vowel space area and speech rate of the specified phrase recorded by participants immediately upon waking and later at 8:00pm 
over a span of three days. By discerning any noticeable patterns in speech rate or vowel space areas, this study aims to contribute valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of vocal articulation. 

Moreover, the insights garnered from this study could significantly contribute to real-world applications, notably in the realm of fatigue/tiredness detection technologies. Understanding how speech parameters such as vowel 
space area and speech rate may be altered by tiredness lays foundational knowledge for developing sophisticated fatigue/tiredness detection systems, particularly for drivers. Such advancements could be pivotal in 
enhancing road safety by alerting drivers of fatigue in real-time, thereby reducing the likelihood of fatigue-related accidents. Additionally, the findings could fuel the creation of more adaptive voice recognition 
systems that account for variations in speech due to different levels of alertness, such as smart home systems. In an era where voice-activated systems are becoming increasingly common in our daily lives, tailoring these 
technologies to accurately respond to speech, regardless of the user's state of tiredness, is imperative. Beyond safety, this study also paves way for improving communication tools and technologies, ensuring they remain 
effective and reliable under varying physiological states. The potential extensions of this research underline its relevance and applicability in addressing contemporary challenges in both safety and communication domains.

## Methods
We conduct research in the following ways:

1. Participant Screening:
We have 5 participants. The gender composition is 1 male and 4 females. The nationality composition is 1 American and 4 Chinese.

2. Experimental design: 
Each participant will be asked to read specific short sentences at two time points over three days. The short sentence text is “Ah, good morning, I’m going to brew a cup of coffee.” The first time point will be set shortly after they wake up to capture morning speech expressions, while the second time point will be set at 8:00 pm to capture evening speech expressions. These two time points were chosen to compare speech performance in the morning and evening.

3. Recording and data collection: 
Participants will be asked to conduct voice recordings at designated time points to ensure that the recording conditions are relatively consistent.

4. Data analysis:
Use praat, python, R and other tools to analyze the participants' recorded speech, and extract related measures of speech speed and vowel space area. We compared morning and evening speech data to detect whether there were significant differences. Use statistical methods and data visualization tools to interpret results.

## Results

Through data visualization, we found that there is a significant difference in VSA values ​​in the morning and evening. The VSA values ​​are lower in the morning and become significantly larger at night. The difference in Speech Rate is smaller. However, the Speech Rate at night is generally higher than in the morning.

## Discussion and Conclusions
Based on the results, we guessed the reasons:
1. Changes in biological clock rhythm and speech characteristics:
VSA changes reflect speech intelligibility in the early morning and evening. A smaller VSA may indicate a more ambiguous or restricted vowel, while a larger VSA may be associated with clearer vowel pronunciation. The vowel space area (VSA) is smaller in the morning, which may be related to the influence of the human body clock rhythm. Morning is the time when the body's body temperature and muscle activity are lowest, which may cause the throat muscles to be tighter, thereby limiting the clarity of vowels and resulting in a smaller VSA. At night, as body temperature rises and muscle activity increases, sound clarity may improve, resulting in a larger VSA.

2. Speech rate and daytime energy difference:
The difference in Speech Rate may be related to the individual's life rhythm and energy level. Slower speech rates in the morning may reflect a lower energy state upon awakening, in which the laryngeal muscles are tense, resulting in slower articulation. In the evening, as the day progresses, the individual may be more active, with a slight increase in speech rate.
