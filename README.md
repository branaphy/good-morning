Authors: Brandi Hongell, Page, Xueying Liu, Yi Lei, Yilan Wei

## Introduction

Fatigue and its impact on cognitive functions have been subjects of extensive research over the years. The state of tiredness, often influenced by the circadian rhythm, can significantly affect an individualâ€™s motor and 
cognitive abilities, thereby potentially altering the acoustic properties of speech. 

The motivation behind this study stems from the curiosity to explore how "morning grogginess" may impact speech production, which could have substantial implications in fields like voice recognition technology, speech 
pathology, and human-computer interaction. The goal of this study is to analyze and compare the vowel space area and speech rate of the specified phrase recorded by participants immediately upon waking and later at 8:00pm 
over a span of three days. By discerning any noticeable patterns in speech rate or vowel space areas, this study aims to contribute valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of vocal articulation. 

Moreover, the insights garnered from this study could significantly contribute to real-world applications, notably in the realm of fatigue/tiredness detection technologies. Understanding how speech parameters such as vowel 
space area and speech rate may be altered by tiredness lays foundational knowledge for developing sophisticated fatigue/tiredness detection systems, particularly for drivers. Such advancements could be pivotal in 
enhancing road safety by alerting drivers of fatigue in real-time, thereby reducing the likelihood of fatigue-related accidents. Additionally, the findings could fuel the creation of more adaptive voice recognition 
systems that account for variations in speech due to different levels of alertness, such as smart home systems. In an era where voice-activated systems are becoming increasingly common in our daily lives, tailoring these 
technologies to accurately respond to speech, regardless of the user's state of tiredness, is imperative. Beyond safety, this study also paves way for improving communication tools and technologies, ensuring they remain 
effective and reliable under varying physiological states. The potential extensions of this research underline its relevance and applicability in addressing contemporary challenges in both safety and communication domains.
